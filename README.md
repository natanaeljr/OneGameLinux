# FirstGameLinux

## Cloning

You should clone the repository with the `recursive` flag, in order to also pull the submodule sources linked in the `external` directory.

```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/natanaeljr/FirstGameLinux.git
```

## Updating

In order to update the repository you can run,

```
git pull
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

## Building

It is recommended that you create a build tree outside of the source tree.
Assuming you are in the directory where you cloned the repository the following commands will create a build tree, configure it and build.

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build .
```

## Development

All project source code is under the `FirstGameLinux` subdirectory. So the sub-project can be worked on independently
from this one.  
The library dependencies should be built at least once though, and remain available for the sub-project to relate to them with from cmake in `find_package/find_library`.  

When using IDEs or LSP (Language Server) the project root should be set to the sub-project directory `FirstGameLinux`, so they can take advantage of the compilation database generated by cmake for the project source code. e.g.:

```
cd FirstGameLinux
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=$(realpath ../../build/external)
cmake --build .
```
